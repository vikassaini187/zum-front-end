                Services Fees (as defined below) before you confirm your reservation.
                Upon submitting a Rides and/or Services Description and requesting
                such Rides and/or Services to be scheduled through the Services, you

                completed by your Zumer (“Rides and/or Services Fees”). Rides
                and/or Services Fees vary based on the particular Rides and/or

                Rides and/or Services Fees for any given Rides and/or Services may
                vary from these estimates based on (i) the amount of time it takes to
                perform your Rides and/or Services (e.g., including the Zumer’s
                waiting time if you, Other Passengers or your Account Passengers (as
                applicable) delay your pick-up and/or departure time, or increased
                Rides and/or Services time due to traffic delays), and (ii) the
                distance travelled during your Rides and/or Services (e.g., if a
                detour is required to avoid adverse road conditions). Your Rides
                and/or Services Fees may also vary if you change your pick-up time
                after confirming your Rides and/or Services reservation, or if your

                the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider - Zumer
                (&quot;Charges&quot;). After you have received services or goods
                obtained through your use of the Service, Zum will facilitate your
                payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party
                Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection
                agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the
                same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider.
                Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law.
                Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise
                determined by Zum. You retain the right to request lower Charges from
                a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from
                such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or
                goods. Zum will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party
                Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.<br><br>

                All
                Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Zum
                using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after
                which Zum will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account
                payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not
                able to be charged, you agree that Zum may, as the Third Party
                Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment
                method in your Account, if available.<br><br>

                and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained
                through the use of the Services at any time in Zum's sole discretion.
                Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain
                geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high
                demand. Zum will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that
                may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred
                under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or
                the amounts thereof. Zum may from time to time provide certain users
                with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different
                amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained
                through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional
                offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have
                no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you.
                You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a
                Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider's
                arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.<br><br>

                This
                payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party

                investors, subsidiaries, and employees) (collectively “Releasees”)
                from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or

                injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent

                Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern

                otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
                proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then

                <u>Arbitration Rules</u>: The

                Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
                Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
                (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this
                “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at
                <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by
                calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will
                govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.<br><br>

                <u>Arbitration Process</u>: A
                party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other
                party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
                Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
                <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a> and a separate form for

                </i> The arbitrator will be either a
                retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be
                selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If
                the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7)
                days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will
                appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.<br><br>

                <u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u></FONT>:
                Unless you and Zum otherwise agree,
                the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If
                your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be
                conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Zum
                submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the
                arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim
                exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the
                AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the
                discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
                parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.<br><br>

                <u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u>: The
                arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in
                the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential
                findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
                Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
                jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be
                consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability”
                section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a
                party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the
                extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
                individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled
                to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided
                under applicable law. Zum will not seek, and hereby waives all rights
                it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and
                expenses if it prevails in arbitration.<br><br>

                <u>Fees</u>:
                Your responsibility to pay any AAA
                filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set
                forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not
                exceed $75,000, Zum will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator
                finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in
                your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an
                improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
                Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).<br><br>

                <u>Time
                    Limitation on Claims</u>: You agree
                that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your
                relationship with Zum and/or these Terms must be filed within one
                year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently
                barred.<br><br>

                <u>Thirty-Day Right to Opt Out</u>: You have the
                right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration- and
                class-action-waiver provisions set forth in this Section 18 by
                sending written notice of your decision to opt out to us.  The notice
                must be sent within 30 days of registering to use the Services;
                otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance
                with these Terms. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Zum
                also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt out
                of these arbitration provisions, Zum may terminate your use of the
